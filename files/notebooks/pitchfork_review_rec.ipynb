After some basic A/B testing, I found Tfidf to be superior, because the recommendations it gave just made more sense. Given a Kanye West album, I got a mix of albums by him and his label mates recommended back. This is likely because a single reviewer writes the reviews for that related group of artists. The CountVectorizer gave more novel, albeit seemingly random, recommendations that I'm not sure are sensible. I suppose it's up to the user which they prefer."

Granted, it would be very difficult to create a recommendation engine that is on par with Spotify's due to the amount of data and compute resources they have at their disposal. I would wager that every minute Spotify collects more data on music preference than I would be able to source in a month. Furthermore, their recommender is likely a complex hybrid system that makes use of several models which are actively being trained with new data--however often they are updated. But I digress, the comparison of my recommendations to Spotify's are below. Also note that the recommendations I give are limited to the albums in this dataset, if I could find a way to similarly limit Spotify's recommendation pool I would do so."
