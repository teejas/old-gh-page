We can use the Echonest dataset which comes with audio features already extracted and use the FMA utils to generate the MFCC."

    "Is a CNN really the best to use for a regression model? [Community](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/335836/cnn-architectures-for-regression) seems to say no, so what's the alternative? We could just change the scope of the problem to a classification one, where instead of extracting audio features like acousticness (on a scale of 0-1) we try to classify by genre. A CNN for genre classification is an interesting idea and maybe a good starting point, but for the time being I'll read more.\n",

Longer reviews would be mapped to vectors with large word frequency values, due to those words appearing more often. But a shorter review with relatively the same differences in frequencies has lower frequency values leading to a greater Euclidean distance between the two despite being similar. Therefore, measuring the angle between the vectors is a better measure of similarity.\n",

    "My initial impression is that this dataset is [multi-tiered](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html), or a dataset made up of clearly defined subsets. There is the umbrella/master set (echonest), sub-categories of which are the different types of data features offered (i.e. audio_features, metadata, social_features, etc), these sub-categories in turn have sub-categories which are the columns of the dataframe. The columns are each a different feature within that type of data feature (i.e. acousticness and danceability under audio_features).\n",

We can leverage this to quickly test and compare the results of measuring similarity between tracks based on different features and types of features. One objective is to have a good understanding of the differences in measuring similarity using different sets of features."
